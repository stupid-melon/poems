Roses are red
Violets are blue
I don't know how to write a good poem
But holy hell I have fallen for you

You are so amazing
You are so pure
To my every problem,
You are the cure

And now,
I have fallen in love
With your personality, 
Which is more than enough

No matter what
I will always be here for you
No matter what it takes
Even if it breaks my heart in two

I will never let you feel alone
I will never let you feel scared
And I will always help you
In this life which is unfair

I will always hold your hand
I will always be there for a hug
I will be here for you
Even if there is a flood

These days,
You are the only thing on my mind
You are the prime example
Of the good in mankind

You have committed a crime
You have stolen my heart
And you have made it better
With your beautiful art

With every breath you take
I fall for you harder
With every smile you give
My love becomes stronger
