Roses are red
Yeah I like bread
I am tired of everything
All this shit I have been fed

I am scared
I just wanna go to bed
Punch myself in the face
Until all I can see is red

Because in the end,
We are all dead
Is this what I want?
Is this where I have been lead?

Or am I just dreaming
And it's all in my fucked up head
Is this my only choice?
The only way to pay this debt?

Is everyone who suicided,
Just a pure soul who fled
The truth is
These thoughts are the reason I am a threat

To everyone who I love
To everyone for whom I ever pled
I know what I will do is right

I am the reason why everyone's so stressed
Now I must go
I must let my blood spread
For tomorrow's a new day
Cause tomorrow, I will finally be dead
