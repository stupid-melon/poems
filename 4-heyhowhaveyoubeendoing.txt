Hey, how have you been doing?
I have been busy
Been facing my problems
instead of being a sissy

Been dealing with the pressure
Been dealing with the pain
But at the end of the day,
It feels like I am fucked up in the brain

I am losing reasons to live
I dont wanna survive
I feel like just a few more cuts,
and then I will thrive

But the truth be told,
It never works
At the end of the day,
Whatever I do sucks

I feel like happiness is a hoax now
Like its a fucking myth
And I feel like its something
that I would never get to fiddle with

I know what I am doing is wrong
and that I should get treated
But even if I get okay,
I don't want all this shit to be repeated

Sometimes, I just wanna climb a tower
And take a leap of faith
In the hope that
I won't have to face anymore hate

Or maybe point a gun at my head
And pull the trigger
In the hope that
I can end all this pain together

Or maybe buy some morphine
and do an overdose
and just lie down and relax
watching as my life draws to a close

I am tired now
I am sorry but I must go to bed
and hope with all my strength
that I wake up dead
