Everyday I feel like dying
I have no more reasons to live
Fail at everything I do
No matter how much I give

Everyday feels like a new test
Which I always seem to fail
It feels like I am riding on a ship
Which is already sinking before it can even sail

Hurt the ones I love
Disappoint the ones who care
I know I am not worth living
I am not worthy of this air

I just wanna grab some pills
Or maybe just get a lil bit high
And cut myself to see how much I bleed
And just lie down and relax until I die

No matter what I do
I am never good enough
No matter how much I try
I just can't seem to get thro this stuff

I am done
I can't take it anymore
If I could wish for one thing,
That would be to drop dead on the floor

And even if I am gone,
Just know that I am in a better place
Don't worry about me
I know I would be remembered as a disgrace

I know I am not gonna make it out alive
I am fucked up beyond repair
But even if I die,
I know nobody would care
