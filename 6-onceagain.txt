Too sad to live,
too scared to die.
Feel alone with all these thoughts,
in this sorrowful bed where i lie

I tried my best.
Trust me i did,
but it wasn't enough,
once again i slipped

Why is it so painful?
Why does it have to be so hard?
Was loving you,
really this bad of a card?

I miss you,
I miss you so much.
I still dream about you,
about your sacred touch

The way you touched my soul,
when I was at my lowest,
and now here I am,
just being unnoticed 

Fuck, why am I even writing this,
this is not my lowest.
Is my coping mechanism, 
just being a shit poet?

You said you ghosted me for mere days,
but it felt like years...
It feels like my heart is full,
full of love and a thousand spears

This is an overreaction,
I know i am being crazy.
But i guess, love is just,
just that mazy

I have trapped myself again,
in this shit called love.
Will i be able to hold myself,
when push comes to shove?

Please, please don't leave,
I need you, i really need you.
Even though you aren't gonna read this,
I hope my words go through
