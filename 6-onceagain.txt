Too sad to live,
too scared to die
feel alone with all these thoughts
in this sorrowful bed where i lie

I tried my best
Trust me i did
but it wasn't enough
once again i slipped

why is it so painful 
why does it have to be so hard
was loving you,
really this bad of a card?

I miss you
i miss you so much
i still dream about you,
about your sacred touch

the way you touched my soul,
when I was at my lowest
and now here I am,
just being unnoticed 

fuck, why am I even writing this,
this is not my lowest.
is my coping mechanism, 
just being a shit poet?

you said you ghosted me for mere days
but it felt like years
It feels like my heart is full,
full of love and a thousand spears

This is an overreaction
i know i am being crazy
but i guess, love is just,
just that mazy

I have trapped myself again,
in this shit called love.
Will i be able to hold myself,
when push comes to shove?

Please, please don't leave
i need you, i really need you
even though you aren't gonna read this,
I hope my words go through
