Fuck why does it,
why does it hurt so much?
It feels like i am holding a burning rope,
a burning rope i love to clutch 

The urges are back,
it's like they were never gone.
You seem so close,
yet so withdrawn

Idk what happened
Idk what i did,
but even if i knew,
would it be something i could live with?

This poem is so shit,
all the verses are uneven.
Is this my last poem?
Will you be my thirteenth reason?

This is my 99th reason,
idk why i am alive.
All i can see is pain,
is it even worth it to survive?

I feel so alone,
it's like no one is there.
But they don't matter
It's only you, who i wish was here

Unfortunately, shit happens,
people change,
but what did i do,
to make you so estranged?

I wish I knew,
I wish I fucking knew.
You just seemed to disappear,
right out of the blue

Or maybe i had just been,
just been ignoring the signs.
I mean, you were just so majestic,
that my heart danced to your rhymes

I think that this is end,
that this is it.
There no point in even trying,
to get out of this endless pit

Honestly, i have felt like this before,
why does love make me feel this way?
But i made it out,
and i can do it again

But why am I like this?
Why does it hurt so much?
I guess i just got a habit,
a habit of fucking things up

Honestly, you deserve better,
I am broken beyond repair.
But i really really need you here,
You're the only thing keeping me from despair

I hope you're doing good,
I hope you're happy,
I hope you find love, 
I hope you find solace in the skies above

It's so hard to let you go,
I don't want to let you go.
But I have to,
it's the only way i know

I will always remember our memories,
no matter how bittersweet.
Because you, my dear,
you made my heart complete
