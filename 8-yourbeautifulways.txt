Every night feels like a challenge,
a challenge I am terrified to face.
I can't stop thinking about you,
about your beautiful ways

I miss you, so fucking much.
I miss the memories we shared.
How even my worst days became better,
just because you were here

I hope things can be how they were.
This is not even a fucking poem.
This is just a rant,
a rant about how your absence leaves me broken

One part of me wishes that,
that I never messaged you on that wretched day.
But the other part of me,
loves you for the pain you took away

How can I miss something that,
that I never had?
Why do I feel this way?
Why did I fall for you this bad?

I still cry over you,
over how you made me feel.
It's like my wounds are just, 
just refusing to heal

I hope that one day,
I can stop feeling this way
I hope that one day,
I can finally say goodbye
