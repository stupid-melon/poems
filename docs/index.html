    <summary>Once Again<sub>(2023)</sub></summary>
    <pre>
too sad to live
too scared to die
feel alone with all these thoughts
in this sorrowful bed where i lie

I tried my best
Trust me i did
but it wasn't enough
once again i slipped

why is it so painful 
why does it have to be so hard
was loving you,
really this bad of a card?

I miss you
i miss you so much
i still dream about you,
about your sacred touch

the way you touched my soul,
when I was at my lowest
and now here I am,
just being unnoticed 

fuck, why am I even writing this,
this is not my lowest.
is my coping mechanism, 
just being a shit poet?

you said you ghosted me for mere days
but it felt like years
It feels like my heart is full,
full of love and a thousand spears

This is an overreaction
i know i am being crazy
but i guess, love is just,
just that mazy

I have trapped myself again,
in this shit called love.
Will i be able to hold myself,
when push comes to shove?

Please, please don't leave
i need you, i really need you
even though you aren't gonna read this,
I hope my words go through

    <summary>The Ship<sub>(2020)</sub></summary>
    <pre>
Everyday I feel like dying
I have no more reasons to live
Fail at everything I do
No matter how much I give

Everyday feels like a new test
Which I always seem to fail
It feels like I am riding on a ship
Which is already sinking before it can even sail

Hurt the ones I love
Disappoint the ones who care
I know I am not worth living
I am not worthy of this air

I just wanna grab some pills
Or maybe just get a lil bit high
And cut myself to see how much I bleed
And just lie down and relax until I die

No matter what I do
I am never good enough
No matter how much I try
I just can't seem to get thro this stuff

I am done
I can't take it anymore
If I could wish for one thing,
That would be to drop dead on the floor

And even if I am gone,
Just know that I am in a better place
Don't worry about me
I know I would be remembered as a disgrace

I know I am not gonna make it out alive
I am fucked up beyond repair
But even if I die,
I know nobody would care

Roses are red
Violets are blue
I don't know how to write a good poem
But holy hell I have fallen for you

You are so amazing
You are so pure
To my every problem,
You are the cure

And now,
I have fallen in love
With your personality, 
Which is more than enough

No matter what
I will always be here for you
No matter what it takes
Even if it breaks my heart in two

I will never let you feel alone
I will never let you feel scared
And I will always help you
In this life which is unfair

I will always hold your hand
I will always be there for a hug
I will be here for you
Even if there is a flood

These days,
You are the only thing on my mind
You are the prime example
Of the good in mankind

You have committed a crime
You have stolen my heart
And you have made it better
With your beautiful art

With every breath you take
I fall for you harder
With every smile you give
My love becomes stronger

    <summary>Hey, how have you been doing?<sub>(2020)</sub></summary>
    <pre>
Hey, how have you been doing?
I have been busy
Been facing my problems
instead of being a sissy

Been dealing with the pressure
Been dealing with the pain
But at the end of the day,
It feels like I am fucked up in the brain

I am losing reasons to live
I dont wanna survive
I feel like just a few more cuts,
and then I will thrive

But the truth be told,
It never works
At the end of the day,
Whatever I do sucks

I feel like happiness is a hoax now
Like its a fucking myth
And I feel like its something
that I would never get to fiddle with

I know what I am doing is wrong
and that I should get treated
But even if I get okay,
I don't want all this shit to be repeated

Sometimes, I just wanna climb a tower
And take a leap of faith
In the hope that
I won't have to face anymore hate

Or maybe point a gun at my head
And pull the trigger
In the hope that
I can end all this pain together

Or maybe buy some morphine
and do an overdose
and just lie down and relax
watching as my life draws to a close

I am tired now
I am sorry but I must go to bed
and hope with all my strength
that I wake up dead

    <summary>I like bread<sub>(2020)</sub></summary>
    <pre>
Roses are red
Yeah I like bread
I am tired of everything
All this shit I have been fed

I am scared
I just wanna go to bed
Punch myself in the face
Until all I can see is red

Because in the end,
We are all dead
Is this what I want?
Is this where I have been lead?

Or am I just dreaming
And it's all in my fucked up head
Is this my only choice?
The only way to pay this debt?

Is everyone who suicided,
Just a pure soul who fled
The truth is
These thoughts are the reason I am a threat

To everyone who I love
To everyone for whom I ever pled
I know what I will do is right
I am the reason why everyone's so stressed

Now I must go
I must let my blood spread
For tomorrow's a new day
Cause tomorrow, I will finally be dead

Bitch I am a mortal,
I aint divine
I have my own problems
But you don't wanna get infected by my vibe

Don't care bout nothing now
I aint got no pride
Put up a fake facade of happiness
While driving myself slowly towards suicide

You thought bruising was bad?
You should sometimes see my arms
I don't think know if I can even get better
Maybe all I need is some damn warmth

But I will be dead before that
I will be gone off this Earth
But I will be doing others a favour
I know I aint got any worth




<hr>



I am at crossroads
Every path I see has pain
I can't see a way to get better
I have nothing left to gain

No matter how hard I try
I know I am gonna end up dead
Or maybe I am too delusional
And its all in my fucked up head

Everyday I wish I was dead
I don't know what is wrong with me
I wish I could just be happy
I wish i could just be free

Just cut my wrists
Slit my throat
Throw me in a river
And let my body float

I don't know where to go
Just wanna put 6 bullets in my brain
I have been told suicide ain't the answer
But I can't see any other way to escape the pain

Roses are red
Yeah I like PewDiePie
I don't wanna live
But I am too scared to die

I thought that my life was worthwhile
But all I wanted was to fly
I wanna numb the pain
I just wanna get high

Now all I can do is
Go to my bed and lie
And when the pain is too much
I just have to cut my blood supply
