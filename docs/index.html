    <summary>Whinings of a broken heart<sub>(2023)</sub></summary>
    <pre>
Fuck why does it,
why does it hurt so much?
It feels like i am holding a burning rope,
a burning rope i love to clutch 

The urges are back,
it's like they were never gone.
You seem so close,
yet so withdrawn

Idk what happened
Idk what i did,
but even if i knew,
would it be something i could live with?

This poem is so shit,
all the verses are uneven.
Is this my last poem?
Will you be my thirteenth reason?

This is my 99th reason,
idk why i am alive.
All i can see is pain,
is it even worth it to survive?

I feel so alone,
it's like no one is there.
But they don't matter
It's only you, who i wish was here

Unfortunately, shit happens,
people change,
but what did i do,
to make you so estranged?

I wish I knew,
I wish I fucking knew.
You just seemed to disappear,
right out of the blue

Or maybe i had just been,
just been ignoring the signs.
I mean, you were just so majestic,
that my heart danced to your rhymes

I think that this is end,
that this is it.
There no point in even trying,
to get out of this endless pit

Honestly, i have felt like this before,
why does love make me feel this way?
But i made it out,
and i can do it again

But why am I like this?
Why does it hurt so much?
I guess i just got a habit,
a habit of fucking things up

Honestly, you deserve better,
I am broken beyond repair.
But i really really need you here,
You're the only thing keeping me from despair

I hope you're doing good,
I hope you're happy,
I hope you find love, 
I hope you find solace in the skies above

It's so hard to let you go,
I don't want to let you go.
But I have to,
it's the only way i know

I will always remember our memories,
no matter how bittersweet.
Because you, my dear,
you made my heart complete

    <summary>Once Again<sub>(2023)</sub></summary>
    <pre>
Too sad to live,
too scared to die.
Feel alone with all these thoughts,
in this sorrowful bed where i lie

I tried my best.
Trust me i did,
but it wasn't enough,
once again i slipped

Why is it so painful?
Why does it have to be so hard?
Was loving you,
really this bad of a card?

I miss you,
I miss you so much.
I still dream about you,
about your sacred touch

The way you touched my soul,
when I was at my lowest,
and now here I am,
just being unnoticed 

Fuck, why am I even writing this,
this is not my lowest.
Is my coping mechanism, 
just being a shit poet?

You said you ghosted me for mere days,
but it felt like years...
It feels like my heart is full,
full of love and a thousand spears

This is an overreaction,
I know i am being crazy.
But i guess, love is just,
just that mazy

I have trapped myself again,
in this shit called love.
Will i be able to hold myself,
when push comes to shove?

Please, please don't leave,
I need you, i really need you.
Even though you aren't gonna read this,
I hope my words go through

    <summary>The Ship<sub>(2020)</sub></summary>
    <pre>
Everyday I feel like dying
I have no more reasons to live
Fail at everything I do
No matter how much I give

Everyday feels like a new test
Which I always seem to fail
It feels like I am riding on a ship
Which is already sinking before it can even sail

Hurt the ones I love
Disappoint the ones who care
I know I am not worth living
I am not worthy of this air

I just wanna grab some pills
Or maybe just get a lil bit high
And cut myself to see how much I bleed
And just lie down and relax until I die

No matter what I do
I am never good enough
No matter how much I try
I just can't seem to get thro this stuff

I am done
I can't take it anymore
If I could wish for one thing,
That would be to drop dead on the floor

And even if I am gone,
Just know that I am in a better place
Don't worry about me
I know I would be remembered as a disgrace

I know I am not gonna make it out alive
I am fucked up beyond repair
But even if I die,
I know nobody would care

Roses are red
Violets are blue
I don't know how to write a good poem
But holy hell I have fallen for you

You are so amazing
You are so pure
To my every problem,
You are the cure

And now,
I have fallen in love
With your personality, 
Which is more than enough

No matter what
I will always be here for you
No matter what it takes
Even if it breaks my heart in two

I will never let you feel alone
I will never let you feel scared
And I will always help you
In this life which is unfair

I will always hold your hand
I will always be there for a hug
I will be here for you
Even if there is a flood

These days,
You are the only thing on my mind
You are the prime example
Of the good in mankind

You have committed a crime
You have stolen my heart
And you have made it better
With your beautiful art

With every breath you take
I fall for you harder
With every smile you give
My love becomes stronger

    <summary>Hey, how have you been doing?<sub>(2020)</sub></summary>
    <pre>
Hey, how have you been doing?
I have been busy
Been facing my problems
instead of being a sissy

Been dealing with the pressure
Been dealing with the pain
But at the end of the day,
It feels like I am fucked up in the brain

I am losing reasons to live
I dont wanna survive
I feel like just a few more cuts,
and then I will thrive

But the truth be told,
It never works
At the end of the day,
Whatever I do sucks

I feel like happiness is a hoax now
Like its a fucking myth
And I feel like its something
that I would never get to fiddle with

I know what I am doing is wrong
and that I should get treated
But even if I get okay,
I don't want all this shit to be repeated

Sometimes, I just wanna climb a tower
And take a leap of faith
In the hope that
I won't have to face anymore hate

Or maybe point a gun at my head
And pull the trigger
In the hope that
I can end all this pain together

Or maybe buy some morphine
and do an overdose
and just lie down and relax
watching as my life draws to a close

I am tired now
I am sorry but I must go to bed
and hope with all my strength
that I wake up dead

    <pre>
Roses are red
Yeah I like bread
I am tired of everything
All this shit I have been fed

I am scared
I just wanna go to bed
Punch myself in the face
Until all I can see is red

Because in the end,
We are all dead
Is this what I want?
Is this where I have been lead?

Or am I just dreaming
And it's all in my fucked up head
Is this my only choice?
The only way to pay this debt?

Is everyone who suicided,
Just a pure soul who fled
The truth is
These thoughts are the reason I am a threat

To everyone who I love
To everyone for whom I ever pled
I know what I will do is right
I am the reason why everyone's so stressed

Now I must go
I must let my blood spread
For tomorrow's a new day
Cause tomorrow, I will finally be dead

Bitch I am a mortal,
I aint divine
I have my own problems
But you don't wanna get infected by my vibe

Don't care bout nothing now
I aint got no pride
Put up a fake facade of happiness
While driving myself slowly towards suicide

You thought bruising was bad?
You should sometimes see my arms
I don't think know if I can even get better
Maybe all I need is some damn warmth

But I will be dead before that
I will be gone off this Earth
But I will be doing others a favour
I know I aint got any worth




<hr>



I am at crossroads
Every path I see has pain
I can't see a way to get better
I have nothing left to gain

No matter how hard I try
I know I am gonna end up dead
Or maybe I am too delusional
And its all in my fucked up head

Everyday I wish I was dead
I don't know what is wrong with me
I wish I could just be happy
I wish i could just be free

Just cut my wrists
Slit my throat
Throw me in a river
And let my body float

I don't know where to go
Just wanna put 6 bullets in my brain
I have been told suicide ain't the answer
But I can't see any other way to escape the pain

Roses are red
Yeah I like PewDiePie
I don't wanna live
But I am too scared to die

I thought that my life was worthwhile
But all I wanted was to fly
I wanna numb the pain
I just wanna get high

Now all I can do is
Go to my bed and lie
And when the pain is too much
I just have to cut my blood supply
