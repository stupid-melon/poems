Bitch I am a mortal,
I aint divine
I have my own problems
But you don't wanna get infected by my vibe

Don't care bout nothing now
I aint got no pride
Put up a fake facade of happiness
While driving myself slowly towards suicide

You thought bruising was bad?
You should sometimes see my arms
I don't think know if I can even get better
Maybe all I need is some damn warmth

But I will be dead before that
I will be gone off this Earth
But I will be doing others a favour
I know I aint got any worth



=================================================================




I am at crossroads
Every path I see has pain
I can't see a way to get better
I have nothing left to gain

No matter how hard I try
I know I am gonna end up dead
Or maybe I am too delusional
And its all in my fucked up head

Everyday I wish I was dead
I don't know what is wrong with me
I wish I could just be happy
I wish i could just be free

Just cut my wrists
Slit my throat
Throw me in a river
And let my body float

I don't know where to go
Just wanna put 6 bullets in my brain
I have been told suicide ain't the answer
But I can't see any other way to escape the pain
